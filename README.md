Laboratory work No. 5 "Lists" is located in this repository. 
In the file Lab_5_Lists.cpp the program code written in C++ is located. 

The stack implementation is implemented using the example of a singly linked list and all its operations. There is also an exchange of maximum and minimum elements for the list. Depth-first traversal (dfs) and width-first traversal (bfs) are implemented, as well as topological sorting.
